# Expense and task tracker

This is a learning project to hone my Python skills as well as learn a backend stack.

This is a backend service for managing tasks and expenses.

Users authenticate and interact via REST API.

Clien -> API -> Database

At this stage 3 features will be completed:
1. Users can register/login
2. Users can create tasks
3. Users can add expenses
